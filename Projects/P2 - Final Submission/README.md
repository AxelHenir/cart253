# Project 2 Final Submission: Generative Audio Visualizer

Hello! Welcome to my CART 253 Final Project!

This program is a generative audio visualizer! It uses generative systems to make visuals that can react to music. My vision for this project was to create a sort of automated music video. To this extent, I've succeeded! However, there's a lot of special care I've taken as an amateur creative coder to make this feel special and personal. Every time you open this program and listen to one of the songs, the visuals will be entirely different every time. You will never see the same video ever. You can make this audiovisual experience even more personal with your microphone too!

When I proposed this project, I was excited to bring something I could call my own to the table. It could just be me, but I also love to share things with people and this project is no different. I have filled my code with comments to help the particularly curious and/or adventurous read through and potentially change the program to make it their own. The way I want to present this project is not solely as something that you can view but also something you can truly interact with down on the level of the code too. The way this program comes shipped isn't the final form, it's the instruction manual to create what you want with it. And I think that this encompasses the whole point of generative art, which is the fascination not of the particularity of the art but rather the possibility.

Thanks for visiting my project! I hope you enjoy it.
