# CART 253 - Exercise: Juggle Garden

Hello! Welcome to my Juggling game!
This program uses Pippin's juggling program as a basis. It adds the following:

-Click to spawn a new ball.
-You have a limited supply of balls.
-Gold coins (new class) can now spawn.
-Every time you juggle, gold coins become closer to spawning in.
-Collect 10 gold coins to finish the game. (Ending 1)
-Drop all balls to lose the game. (Ending 2)
-You will be given a score based on the amount of time it take to collect 10 gold.

Will you be slow and methodical in your juggling or will you cast doubts aside and juggle all the balls at once to collect the 10 gold the fastest? Can you beat my high score of 9.53 seconds? :)
