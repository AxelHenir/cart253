This program will occasionally generate a shape on the bounary of the square canvas.
This shape will be given inate qualities based mouse position within the canvas.
Random chance will also be used when deciding the qualities of the shapes.

Once a shape is generated, it will travel towards the opposite side of the canvas.
shapes are generated with a point called the terminal point.
If a shape reaches its terminal point, it will stop.
For the shape to move again, it must be generated again.

Generated shapes can be influenced through mouse position.
Fill, Stroke, Size and Rotation can all be influenced live.
