# Exercise 4 - Dodge Em

This program was made using the activity 4 code as its foundation.

I made many modifications and transformed it into a roguelike game!
You can use WASD to move your character, K to dash and L to shield.
The onslaught of enemies will become increasingly difficult to avoid
as they will grow in size, number and speed. If you touch an enemy,
you will quickly lose HP. If your HP depletes to zero, you lose the game.
You are able to soak up damage using your shield. You can store up to 3
of your dashes and use them when you need. Dashes will refresh automatically.
Your shield can also regenerate if you avoid taking damage for a few seconds.

Can you beat my high score of 6563?  :]
