# Love, actually

In this program, you must help little ghosty find love. Ghosts are timid creatures
and require a suggestion to act. You can suggest where ghosty should go next by typing
the direction you want him to move ("up", "down", "left" and "right"). Walk over the
green upgrade squares to boost your vision radius and spot your ghosty partner from
further away.
